# Solution:

# Input:
# The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
# The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of vertices of the triangle.
# The second line contains N space separated integers, the coordinates of the vertices.
# Output:
# The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
# The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of vertices of the triangle.
